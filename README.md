## First Time Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the solution for the first time.

### Environment
- Install Visual Studio 2019 (or later) Community Edition with the "ASP.NET and web development" workload
- Install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Angular Language Service extension
- Install SQL Server 2017 (or later) Developer Edition and make sure it is accessible on "." with Windows authentication
- Install NodeJS (LTS edition) from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install Angular CLI globally by running the following in cmd: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Install typescript globally by running the following in cmd: `npm install -g typescript`

### IDEs
- Use Visual Studio to open Tellma.sln
- Use Visual Studio Code to open the Angular project in (SolutionDir)/Tellma.Api.Web/ClientApp/

### Database Tier
- Right-Click -> Publish the project Tellma.Database.Admin to a database `[Tellma]` on SQL server "."
- Right-Click -> Publish the project Tellma.Database.Application to a separate database `[Tellma.101]` on the same server "." setting the SQLCMD variables as follows:

	| SQLCMD Variable | Value |
	| ------------------ | ------------- |
	| DeployEmail | admin@tellma.com  |
	| OverwriteDb | 1  |
	| FunctionalCurrency | USD  |
	| PrimaryLanguageId | en  |
	| SecondaryLanguageId | NULL  |
	| TernaryLanguageId | NULL  |
	| ShortCompanyName | Contoso Ltd.  |
	| ShortCompanyName2 | NULL  |
	| ShortCompanyName3 | NULL  |

- In the Admin database, run the following script: 
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

DECLARE @Email NVARCHAR(255) = N'admin@tellma.com'

EXEC [dal].[AdminUsers__CreateAdmin] @Email = @Email, @FullName = N'Administrator'

-- Add [Tellma.101] DB to the sharding catalogue
DECLARE @ServerId INT = (SELECT [Id] FROM [dbo].[SqlServers] WHERE [ServerName] = N'<AdminServer>')
DECLARE @AdminId INT = (SELECT [Id] FROM [dbo].[AdminUsers] WHERE [Email] = @Email)
INSERT INTO [dbo].[SqlDatabases] ([Id], [DatabaseName], [ServerId], [CreatedById], [ModifiedById])
VALUES (101, N'Tellma.101', @ServerId, @AdminId, @AdminId)

-- Add membership for the admin user in [Tellma.101]
DECLARE @DirectoryAdminId INT = (SELECT [Id] FROM [dbo].[DirectoryUsers] WHERE [Email] = @Email)
INSERT INTO [dbo].[DirectoryUserMemberships] ([UserId], [DatabaseId])
VALUES (@DirectoryAdminId, 101)

COMMIT;
```

### Application Tier
- Make sure the project Tellma.Api.Web is your startup project (Right-Click -> Set as Startup Project)

### Client Tier
- Install all ClientApp npm dependencies as follows: Go inside "(SolutionDir)/Tellma.Api.Web/ClientApp/" in cmd and run: `npm install`

## Running The App
Follow these steps to run the solution on your development machine:
- Make sure you pull the latest version of the solution from GitHub
- Make sure the latest version of the admin and app databases are published to `[Tellma]` and `[Tellma.101]`
- Make sure the latest ClientApp npm dependencies are installed: Go inside "(SolutionDir)/Tellma.Api.Web/ClientApp/" and run: `npm install`
- Start the backend server on https://localhost:5001/ as follows: Visual Studio -> Debug -> Start Without Debugging. This should launch a debug console similar to this:

- Start the client app server on http://localhost:4200/ as follows: 
	- Open cmd
	- Navigate to "(SolutionDir)/Tellma.Api.Web/ClientApp/" 
	- Run `ng serve -o`

- Sign in with username: `admin@tellma.com` and default password: `Admin@123`

## Optional Configuration
In your development environment you can use the [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) of project Tellma.Api.Web to add additional functionality or override any of the default settings in `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.

### To Enable Email
- Right-Click the project Tellma.Api.Web -> Manage User Secrets, this opens a file `secrets.json` containing a JSON object
- Add the following properties inside the JSON object:
```json
  "EmailEnabled": true,
  "Email": {
    "SendGrid": {
      "ApiKey": "(YourSendGridApiKey)",
      "CallbacksEnabled": false
    }
  }
```
- Replace (YourSendGridApiKey) with a real SendGrid API key, you can grab one for free from [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

### To Enable SMS
- Right-Click the project Tellma.Api.Web -> Manage User Secrets, this opens a file `secrets.json` containing a JSON object
- Add the following properties inside the JSON object:
```json
  "SmsEnabled": true,
  "Twilio": {
    "AccountSid": "(YourTwilioAccountSid)",
    "AuthToken": "(YourTwilioAuthToken)",
    "Sms": {
      "ServiceSid": "(YourTwilioServiceSid)",
      "CallbacksEnabled": false
    }
  }
```
- Replace all placeholders (Your...) with real values, you can grab those values from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

### To Use Custom Port Numbers
If you want to run the client app server on a port number other than 4200, follow these steps:
- Right-Click the project Tellma.Api.Web -> Manage User Secrets, this opens a file `secrets.json` containing a JSON object
- Add the following property inside the JSON object:
```json
  "ClientApplications": {
    "WebClientUri": "http://localhost:(YourClientPortNumber)"
  }
```
- Replace (YourClientPortNumber) with your custom port number

If you want to run the backend server on a port number other than 5001, follow these steps:
- Launch the client app in the browser
- Using the browser's developer tools open the console and run `localStorage.appsettings = "{\"apiAddress\":\"https://localhost:(YourBackendPortNumber)\"}"` replacing (YourBackendPortNumber) with your custom port number
- Refresh the client app in the browser
- The preconfigured credentials for Google and Microsoft redirect only to http://localhost:5001, so either remove them or add your own credentials for your custom port number:
	- Right-Click the project Tellma.Api.Web -> Manage User Secrets, this opens a file `secrets.json` containing a JSON object
	- To remove the preconfigured credentials, add the following property inside the JSON object:
	```json
	  "EmbeddedIdentityServer": {
	    "Google": {
	      "ClientId": "",
	      "ClientSecret": ""
	    },
	    "Microsoft": {
	      "ClientId": "",
	      "ClientSecret": ""
	    }
	  }
	```
	- Or you can grab your custom credentials from Google Developer Console and Microsoft Azure
